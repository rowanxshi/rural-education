# Investigating whether education results in migration from rural to urban areas

This project is quick look at the above question, using Honduras census data.

## Structure

All code is in `./source/`, all data (both original and outputted) is in `./data/`, and all output files are in `./out/`.

All that is needed is to run the `./source/run.sh` file, while will produce `./out/summary.html`, the rendered report.

Original data is downloaded from IPUMS-international, and therefore cannot be disseminated here. However, the codebook is provided at `./ipumsi_00002.txt` for easy replication. The downloaded IPUMS data should be placed in the `./data/` directory.
